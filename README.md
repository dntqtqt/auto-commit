# automated-commit

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically updates a file named `TIMESTAMP.txt` with the current date and time every 12 hours. This README provides a detailed overview of how the workflow operates and how you can work with it, especially if you're new to GitHub or GitHub Actions.

## Overview

The `automated-commit` workflow is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of GitHub Actions for automating routine tasks within a repository. Specifically, this workflow:

- Checks out the latest code from the `master` branch.
- Updates the `TIMESTAMP.txt` file with the current date and time.
- Commits the change to the repository if any modifications are detected.
- Uses a custom GitHub Action to push the changes back to the `master` branch.

## Workflow Structure

The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/master.yml` file and consists of several key components:

- **Triggers**: The workflow is configured to run automatically every 12 hours based on a schedule defined using cron syntax. Additionally, it can be manually triggered using the GitHub UI through the `workflow_dispatch` event.

- **Jobs and Steps**: The workflow contains a job named `update_commit` that runs on the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub Actions. This job comprises several steps, including setting up Git, modifying the `TIMESTAMP.txt` file, and committing and pushing the changes.

- **Permissions**: The workflow is granted write permissions to the contents of the repository, enabling it to commit and push changes.

## Working with the Workflow

### Viewing Workflow Runs

To see the history of workflow runs:

1. Navigate to the `Actions` tab of this repository.
2. Click on the `automated-commit` workflow from the list.
3. Here, you can view each run's details, including start times, durations, and outcomes.

### Manually Triggering the Workflow

Although the workflow runs automatically, you can also trigger it manually:

1. Go to the `Actions` tab of this repository.
2. Click on the `automated-commit` workflow.
3. Click the `Run workflow` button, choose the `master` branch, then click `Run workflow` again.

### Making Changes to the Workflow

If you wish to modify the workflow (e.g., changing the schedule or the file being updated):

1. Open the `.github/workflows/master.yml` file.
2. Make your changes in the editor. For example, to change the schedule, modify the `cron` value under the `schedule` trigger.
3. Commit your changes. GitHub Actions will automatically recognize and apply these changes to subsequent workflow runs.
